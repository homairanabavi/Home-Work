Hello World
If you are here to learn more about GIT & GITHUP, I gotta tell you that they are two separate pieces of software.
Git is a free, open source version control tool that developers install locally on their personal computers, 
while GitHub is a pay-for-use online service built to run Git in the cloud.

Git is a piece of software. 
GitHub is an online SaaS service. 
Yet despite this distinction, Git and GitHub are not competitive offerings. 
Instead, they work together and complement each other.

What is Git?
Git bills itself as a simple and easy-to-use distributed version control tool.
Developers can take snapshots of their code at various points in time, creating a version history that maps their 
software development process. (That's why Git is called a version control tool.) 
Developers can collaboratively share these code snapshots, or commits, with any number of other developers, 
located anywhere in the world by pushing it to GITHUP and make is accessible for them only through GITHUP.

Basic Git commands
Developers who worked with Git 10 years ago would use the same set of basic git commands today, 
such as the following:

git init to create a repository.
git clone to copy a remote repository.
git add to stage a file.
git commit to snapshot their code.
git merge to combine branches.
git rebase to simplify their commit history.
git fetch and git pull to update their repositories.
git push to share their code with others.
git squash and git clean for housekeeping.

What is GitHub?
GitHub is an online software development platform. 
It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects.
It makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers 
on open-source projects. GitHub also serves as a social networking site where developers 
can openly network, collaborate, and pitch their work.
